Here’s everywhere @mneno11 and I went!:🥐 @brooklynfrenchbakers_ (flaky, buttery pastries and beautiful breads. I went for cardamom, of course 😍) 🪑 @lanobadesign (curated collection of vintage Danish furniture, all refurbished in house. I had to get the lazy Susan and it’s my favorite purchase of the year) ☕️ @cafehereforyou (had to be a stop because I will always make time for an Ube Latte 💜) 🍷 @redhookwinery (I absolutely adore anywhere with orange wines and theirs were some of the best I’ve had. Plus the views!) 🍺 @strongropebrewery (crisp brews and really nice IPAs with water views and outdoor space) 🐮 @hometownbarbque (this place needs to be on your radar immediately. Juicy brisket, creamy Mac, and some of the best collards of my life) 🥃 @botanicawidowjane (stunning cocktail bar featuring @widowjane and big open doors on warm days)  @360recordshop (felt like a time capsule in the best way and the community vibes were palpable)  Stop 1 we drove to but after that we parked and walked everywhere! This is a perfect day trip for September because it’s warm enough to be by the water but too cool for a beach day.

My first-ever group hike was today at Schooley’s Mountain Park, so this place will forever be one of my favorites 🥹. It’s got everything… woodsy trails, multiple waterfalls, and an overlook that makes you stop and stare. The trail to the main waterfall is short and easy, but if you keep going, you’ll stumble on hidden cascades most people miss. Perfect when you want nature and views all in one trip!📍 Schooley’s Mountain Park, Long Valley, NJ PS: There’s a ton of parking (I counted over 100 spots!), which is why I picked it for the meetup. Just plug it into Google Maps and you’re set! Follow along for more hidden gems 🩷 #njhiking #njspots #njisbeautiful",

Make a reservation online in advance, and pay in cash ($20 per person) when you arrive.  Prepare to not have cell service while you’re there. Bring your own towel and water! Alcohol, glass, and food not allowed by the pools. •I’d recommend bringing sandals you can wear in the water.  In the winter, you’ll likely need shoes with good traction to get down the steps to the pools, and know that AWD/snow tires or chains are needed on the icy roads. There are also shuttles you can book instead.  There are changing rooms, but we preferred to show up already in our swimsuits!  There are bathrooms! 🚽  It’s clothing optional after dark (~9pm right now), so minors and electronics aren’t allowed after the sun sets!

It’s instagrammable and influencer ready - but to reduce it to just that would not be doing them justice. \n\nMy first impressions are good. The interior is small but cute; the open kitchen clearly shows the effort and care that goes into the desserts. I admit I’m surprised- the two chefs inside are Ukrainian - contrary to the majority of Asian based places I’ve been to NYC. \n\nThe menu is equally interesting; I see an unexpected amalgamation of flavors and mediums - lime, mint, tonic, and espresso; bubble gum and raspberry mousse in mochi; coconut and mango in milkshake boba. \nI ask for recommendations and one of the chefs helps me order. I soon find out that he is Pavlo, the owner and namesake of Pavlo’s mochi. My order consists of Mango passion fruit vanilla, Pistachio raspberry, Matcha raspberry, and Strawberry caramel. \n\nThe mochis are packed with care with garnishes of cut fruit on top. It’s clear that they are carefully crafted. I already know my favorite flavor will be the Mango Passionfruit Vanilla, so I reach for it first. I take a bite into the pillowy treat and am instantly in love. The mochi is soft and chewy with a thin but elastic texture that makes it easy to bite off. It encompasses a soft subtle vanilla mousse filling, complemented by a more tart passion fruit puree. The ripe mango on top is the perfect finish. \n\nMy black skirt is covered in the powdery dusting that are brushed on top of the treats to keep them from sticking but I am too occupied to care. The rest of the mochis are equally decedent though nothing can top the first bite I had.\n\n“How was it?” Pavlo asks. I rave about them as I’m sure every customer does. “The menu is interesting though- how did you come up with it?” \n\nPavlo shrugs. I was a chef before this, he says. You learn things when you’re in a kitchen; you exchange knowledge and try new things whether it be Asian or European. (Continued in comments)",

There is so much to explore there, but ESPECIALLY waterfalls! These are my favorites. 👇🏻\n\n📍 Taughannock Falls Overlook and State Park\nYou can either visit the overlook (pictured) for free, or pay to park at the state park and hike to the base of this waterfall!\n\n📍 Letchworth State Park\nThis park is STUNNING and we were honestly shocked it wasn’t a national park. Make sure to hit up all the viewpoints of the 3 falls in the park, but Middle Falls Lookout is my favorite!\n\n📍 Montour Falls, NY\nThis village is called “the valley of tumbling waters” for a reason! There are waterfalls all over the place—even on the sides of the roads! Make sure to grab a coffee or tea at North New York while visiting!\n\n📍 Buttermilk Falls State Park\nThis state park is lovely and has a great gorge hike alongside Buttermilk Creek. You can also camp there (and swim if you visit in the summer!)\n\n📍 Watkins Glen State Park\nHave you ever seen 19 waterfalls in one state park? Well you can here! This state park is one of my favorites ever and is worth the stop. Just be sure you go early enough in fall that the Gorge Trail is still open!\n\nHave you been to any of these spots before? 🍁🧡\n\n#newyork #autumninnewyork #upstate #upstateny #upstatenewyork #newyorktravel #newyorktrip #discovernewyork #naturalnewyork #onlyinnewyork #watkinsglen #taughannockfalls #buttermilkfalls #montourfalls #letchworth #letchworthstatepark #autumntravel #falltravel",

I love NYS, because you can spend the morning in the heart of Manhattan, and the same evening be up in the Catskill or Adirondack Mountains with nobody around. I’ve always looked at living here as the best of both worlds, between urban and nature. If you’re planning on visiting NYS, these are some of the places I’d recommend checking out:\n\nHudson Valley:\n-Ferncliff Forest\n-Poet’s Walk\n-Mt. Beacon\n-Walkway over the Hudson\n-Millbrook Winery\n\nCatskills:\n-Kaaterskill Falls\n-Overlook Mountain\n-Hunter Mountain Fire Tower\n-Giant Ledge\n-Devil’s Path\n\nAdirondacks: \n-Whiteface Mountain\n-Indian Head\n-Mount Marcy\n-Saranac Lake\n-Ampersand Mountain\n\nCentral NY/Finger Lakes:\n-Taughannock Falls State Park\n-Watkins Glen \n-Buttermilk Falls\n-Lucifer Falls\n-Cayuga Lake\n\nWestern NY:\n-Niagra Falls\n-Letchworth State Park \n\nAnd if you do visit, it’s so important to remember to Leave No Trace and recreate responsibly. Explore the beautiful outdoors of Upstate NY while preserving its natural beauty for future generations.\n\nRemember to:\n\n- Pack it in, pack it out: Take all trash and belongings with you when you leave.\n- Stay on trails: Prevent erosion and protect sensitive habitats.\n- Respect wildlife: Keep a safe distance and don't feed them.\n- Be mindful of campfires: Follow local regulations and fully extinguish before leaving.\n- Keep water sources clean: Avoid soap and chemical contamination.\n\nLet's leave places the Adirondacks and Catskills just as stunning as we found them.\n\nAs always, feel free to comment or message me for Upstate NY travel itineraries, recommendations, or hiking info. Follow @lukekellytravels for more travel ideas.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#upstateny #nyc #earthfocus #iloveny #earthpix #like #beautifuldestinations #wanderlust #mountains #hiking# #hudsonvalley #love #hiking#optoutside #ispyny #catskills #hudsonvalley #adirondacks #Wander #upstate #newyork #adks #lakeplacid #paradise #tlpicks #fishing #lake #sunrise #summer",

Explore hidden waterfalls, natural pools, and diverse wildlife! 💧 🦅 \n\nGetting to Ruta del Rio Fraile:\n📍 The closest town is Bicorp, Valencia.\n🚗 You’ll need a car to reach the trailhead. From Valencia, take the A-7 and CV-590 towards Bicorp. Look for signs for the “Ecomuseo de Bicorp.”\n💶 Parking is available near the official starting point, with a daily fee.\n\nHiking Routes:\n1️⃣ Lower Route (Barranco del Fraile): This is the shorter and easier route, perfect for families and beginners. It starts near the Peña Cortada swimming area and follows the river downstream, offering stunning views and natural pools. (Approximately 1.5 km round trip)\n2️⃣ Upper Route (Circular Ruta del Fraile): This longer route offers a more challenging hike with breathtaking views. It winds through the canyon, passing waterfalls and hidden coves. Be sure to wear proper footwear. (Approximately 4 km round trip)\n\nBest Time to Visit:\n📆 Spring (April-May) and Fall (September-October) offer pleasant temperatures for hiking.\n🔥 Avoid peak summer months (July-August) as it can get very hot and crowded.\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 Weekdays are generally less crowded than weekends.\n\n📽 @paulamoratal\n📍 Ruta Río Fraile, Valencia, Spain \n#beautifuldestinations #beautifulspain",

The food is amazing & incredibly affordable! \n\n📍 Location: Red Bank Farmer’s Market, Red Bank, New Jersey \n💵 Prices: $ Affordable \n🪑 Seating: there are a couple of shared benches outside of the cart\n🍴The menu from the week we went included: \n• Chili Crisp Jackfruit Spring Roll ⭐️ \n• Lemongrass Roasted Tofu \n• Bird’s Eye Chili Mac & Cheese ⭐️ \n• Sambal Goreng Shiitake Mushroom Bao \n\n⭐️ = our favorites \n\n⚠️ Things to note: the menu changes weekly so you can not find it ahead of time & it is CASH ONLY.

The sunset views are a huge bonus since you don’t get that at many NJ beaches.\n\nWhen I went so many people were camping on the beach overnight but I’m not sure if it’s technically allowed. Also, there’s an amusement park that’s free to enter!

Nonetheless, based on the rave reviews this restaurant got, I decided to give it a try — and OMG WOW.\n\n🪴To celebrate a special occasion, we did the ✨14-course ✨tasting experience and every dish (and I mean EVERY) was out of this world incredible. I couldn’t believe it was all vegetables. Each dish was like a work of art telling a story and packed with flavors of Latin America. I don’t think I’ve had anything quite like it. Cocktails were also🔥\n\n✨My stand out dish of the night was definitely the soup — can’t remember the name but it was part of the prix fixe menu and oh lord, the DEPTH OF FLAVORS? Give this restaurant a MICHELIN STAR ⭐️ already. It’s honestly so deserving and more. \n\n‼️Did you know @mita_dc was just announced as one of the “25 BEST RESTAURANTS IN DC right now” by the @nytimes?? That’s right!! It’s so deserved 🤩\n\n🥗If you’re skeptical like I was at first trying an all vegetable fine dining restaurant, give this place a try and thank me later 🤗 — and if you’re worried about not feeling satisfied after a vegetable-only meal, trust me you’ll be FULL, barely a worry you won’t need to have 😉 \n\n📍Mita 🌱| Washington, DC\n\n🏷️ \nVegan, vegetarian, fine dining restaurant, vegetable cuisine, plant-based, plant forward cuisine, vegan cuisine, vegetarian food, dc restaurant, Washington DC, Latin American flavors, Latin America, Latin American food",
